### Hey there!

#### Who am I?

I am **Gabriel Schincariol Cavalcante**, born in Boituva, a small city in the state of S√£o Paulo. At 17 I went to the Air Force Cadets School, where I started to write more frequently as a way to face the strict military routine. I graduated from **Law School at the University of S√£o Paulo** (#1 in Brazil and South America, #46 World Wide). However, I am not a lawyer, but a **writer**. In 2021 my first book was published, Um mundo em que existem baleias (A World With Whales), by Patu√°, an indie publisher. At the moment, besides writing fiction and non-fiction, I've been studying web development, as a way to put together my writing and creative skills with tech tools.

- üå± I've gone through some cool courses, such as **The Web Developer Bootcamp**, by Colt Steele, and **JavaScript Ninja**, by Fernando Daciuk
- üî≠ Right now, I'm studying React on **The Modern React Bootcamp**
- ‚ö° What can I do? I can do **creative writing, content writing, copywriting** - heck, anything with writing! You can check my [Medium](https://gschincariol.medium.com) to see what I am up to. Now I am also mastering my skills in web development ü§ì
- üó£ I am from Brazil, so I am a native Portuguese speaker, but I am also fluent in English
- ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è thebigfundamentals is my nickname because I am a San Antonio Spurs fan and Tim Duncan Is The Goat! (if you didn't know TD is called [The Big Fundamental](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1670561-how-tim-ducan-got-and-earned-his-nickname-the-big-fundamental), now you know)

Get in touch with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gschincariol/?locale=en_US), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tbfundamentals), or wherever you want.

Cheers!
